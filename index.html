                    <h3>What is a Resume?</h3>
                    <p>A resume is a document used by individuals to present their background, skills, and accomplishments. 
                    It is typically used to apply for jobs, internships, or academic programs. A well-crafted resume should 
                    highlight your most relevant experiences and achievements, providing a concise overview of your qualifications.</p>

                    <h3>What Creates a Good Resume?</h3>
                    <p>A good resume is clear, concise, and tailored to the job you are applying for. It should include 
                    sections such as contact information, a summary or objective, work experience, education, and skills. 
                    Using action verbs and quantifying your achievements can make your resume more impactful. Customizing 
                    your resume for each application can also increase your chances of standing out to employers.</p>

                    <h3>Difference Between Resume and CV</h3>
                    <p>Resumes are typically shorter and focused on specific job skills, while CVs (Curriculum Vitae) are 
                    more detailed and comprehensive, often used for academic, research, and scientific positions. A resume 
                    is usually one to two pages long, whereas a CV can be multiple pages, including publications, presentations, 
                    and other professional activities.</p>

                    <h3>What is ATS and How to Ace It?</h3>
                    <p>ATS (Applicant Tracking System) is software that employers use to manage recruitment. To ace it, use 
                    keywords from the job description and keep your resume format simple. Avoid complex formatting, graphics, 
                    and tables that might not be parsed correctly by the ATS. Instead, focus on using standard headings and bullet 
                    points to make your resume ATS-friendly.</p>
